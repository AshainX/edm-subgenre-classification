Components of a Mel Spectrogram:

	•	X-axis (Time): Represents the progression of time.
	•	Y-axis (Frequency in Mel scale): Represents the different frequencies in Mel scale, from low to high.
	•	Color Intensity: Represents the amplitude or energy at each frequency band at a given time. Brighter or darker regions indicate stronger or weaker amplitudes.
